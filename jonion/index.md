# Jonion

Jonion is a lightweight, modular plugin framework for Java applications. It provides a clean, layered architecture that allows developers to build extensible systems by stacking functionality through independent plugins.

At its core, Jonion emphasizes simplicity and flexibility. Each plugin can have its own configuration, metadata descriptors, and lifecycle, while the framework handles loading, dependencies, and file formats. Jonion supports YAML natively and can be extended to other formats through adapters, giving developers full control over how data is stored and loaded.

Designed for both small utilities and complex applications, Jonion makes building modular Java software approachable. Its clear API, multi-format support, and extensibility options ensure that projects can grow organically without sacrificing maintainability.
